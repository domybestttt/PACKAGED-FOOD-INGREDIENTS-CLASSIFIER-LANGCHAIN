# PACKAGED-FOOD-INGREDIENTS-CLASSIFIER-LANGCHAIN
Langchain Based Model

The model is Langchain based.
The dataset used is created by myself. 
The dataset is ingredients of packaged foods like potato,corn and some popular Indian Namkeen brand ingredients which is commonly used. 
I've taken help of my Biology-studying friends and some online references to classfy the data as healthy/unhealthy/moderate.
